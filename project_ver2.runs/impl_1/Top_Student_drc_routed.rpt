PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net display_control/spi_word_reg[39]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin display_control/pixel_data[15]_i_2/O, cell display_control/pixel_data[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net nolabel_line112/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin nolabel_line112/oled_color_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell nolabel_line112/oled_color_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT display_control/pixel_data[15]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
